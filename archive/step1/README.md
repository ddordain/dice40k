# Basic Monte Carlo Simulation

A basic Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the average number of attacks that successfully hit, wound, and bypass saves. Additionally, it determines a confidence threshold, indicating the minimum number of successful attacks in a given percentage of scenarios.


# TODO

Reroll of hits and wounds is top priority.
